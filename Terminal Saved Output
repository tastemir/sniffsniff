       git push origin HEAD
           A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote.

       git push mothership master:satellite/master dev:satellite/dev
           Use the source ref that matches master (e.g.  refs/heads/master) to update the ref that matches satellite/master (most probably refs/remotes/satellite/master) in the
           mothership repository; do the same for dev and satellite/dev.

           This is to emulate git fetch run on the mothership using git push that is run in the opposite direction in order to integrate the work done on satellite, and is often
           necessary when you can only make connection in one way (i.e. satellite can ssh into mothership but mothership cannot initiate connection to satellite because the latter is
           behind a firewall or does not run sshd).

           After running this git push on the satellite machine, you would ssh into the mothership and run git merge there to complete the emulation of git pull that were run on
           mothership to pull changes made on satellite.

       git push origin HEAD:master
           Push the current branch to the remote ref matching master in the origin repository. This form is convenient to push the current branch without thinking about its local
           name.

       git push origin master:refs/heads/experimental
           Create the branch experimental in the origin repository by copying the current master branch. This form is only needed to create a new branch or tag in the remote
           repository when the local name and the remote name are different; otherwise, the ref name on its own will work.

       git push origin :experimental
           Find a ref that matches experimental in the origin repository (e.g.  refs/heads/experimental), and delete it.

       git push origin +dev:master
           Update the origin repository's master branch with the dev branch, allowing non-fast-forward updates.  This can leave unreferenced commits dangling in the origin repository.
           Consider the following situation, where a fast-forward is not possible:

                           o---o---o---A---B  origin/master
                                    \
                                     X---Y---Z  dev

           The above command would change the origin repository to

                                     A---B  (unnamed branch)
                                    /
                           o---o---o---X---Y---Z  master

           Commits A and B would no longer belong to a branch with a symbolic name, and so would be unreachable. As such, these commits would be removed by a git gc command on the
           origin repository.

SECURITY
       The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be shared. If you have private data that
       you need to protect from a malicious peer, your best option is to store it in another repository. This applies to both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a
       server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire repository.

       The known attack vectors are as follows:

        1. The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also
           has them. The attacker chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn't required to send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the victim
           believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by
           creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a public
           branch and hope that the user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge.)

        2. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so
           the victim sends Y as a delta against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.
